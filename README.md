# Period Cycle Prediction

## About 

Artificial intelligence implementation for better cycle predictions. 

The period can be uncertain when a woman has irregular cycles. Moreover, the length of the period cycle varies from woman to woman. Therefore, every woman has a particular cycle. AI can help us to understand better about women cycles.

In this project, we applied some machine learning models to predict the period cycle. We generated a synthetic dataset.
